Time Explanation:
3.18 is the fastest time with slow downs I've recorded.
managed to get a 3.16 unrecorded also with slow downs.
Not attempted to code a run with input tools, 
but could probably go lower to 3.15-3.14 potentially,
unless 3.16 is perfect, but it didn't really seem that hard to achieve,
(only around 10-15 minutes of attempts, with 0.25x speed so I was doing 4 times less runs in that time span)
so I can't really see 3.16 being unbeatable.

Run Explanation:
Jumps after around 9-11 frames
