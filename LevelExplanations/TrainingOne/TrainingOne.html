    <h2>Currently the fastest time achieved using tools is 3.18</h2>
    <h3>How the run works:</h3>
    <p>The run is quite simple, but has some nuance to it. Just hold the left arrow key, fall off the platform (I call it the Turnaround Room), you turn around after falling off the platform, moving to the right, two more jumps and you've made it to the TARDIS completing the level in aroudn 3-4 seconds. very short, very simple level.
        You start the run holding the Left Arrow Key (A Key), roughly 9-11 frames into the run (The earliest I have found is 9 frames) you press the Up Arrow Key (W/Space Key) to jump, this causes you to jump upwards seemingly unnecessarily, but it doesn't actually lose you any time because your still holding the Left Arrow key so you're still moving the direction you need to, this jump will help build momentum that you normally wouldn't have without the jump for a trick in a second. After you reach the apex of your jump, you naturally begin to fall, building downward momentum, this is important because the original strategy had you just run to the left, and then come to a complete stop as you fall off the platform in the Turnaround Room, meaning you have to build that downward momentum later, this trick means you can build that momentum for longer and without losing you any time to slowdowns. If you timed your jump well enough, you'll just about be able to fall below the platform, you then need to time a left arrow release and a right arrow press well enough so that you don't accidentally land back on the platform in the Turnaround Room. if you timed all of that well, theres no more time to be saved, just hold right and do the two necessary jumps to reach the TARDIS without releasing right and the run should be complete, the only areas to save time are in timing your first jump early enough to not accidentally land back on the platform, and timing the Right arrow press early enough but not too early.
        
        The fastest time I have achieved with this strategy without tools was a 3.21 second time, but the fastest I have achieved with the use of slow downs and tools to help me was a 3.18 second time. obviously this run doesn't count because it was tool assisted, but it does show that there is at least 1 frame of time save possible (Because the game runs a 30 FPS) the fastest time I have achieved unrecorded with tools was a 3.16 but this wouldn't actually save any time Single Segment because it is less than a frame quicker than the 3.18, a 3.15 would have to be possible for this to be a potential time save. So currently, the human achieved record on this level is 1 frame behind currently known perfection. </p>
